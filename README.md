## Release information

`@orthly/context` is actually used in production at Dandy by thousands of users,
so we ensure that a certain amount of testing and stability can always be relied upon.

Though the code on `master` will be generally stable, only tagged commits on GitHub
can be considered to be stable. These tagged commits will be released to npm under the
`latest` tag, while the latest copy of master will be tagged `next`.

    Note: versions 0.x.x (below v1) are subject to API changes. We're still figuring
    out the optimal consumer experience for this library, and will release v1 when we
    are confident that the API is stable.
